# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application
This is the sample application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Development with Rails*](https://github.com/cengjing/rails_turo_in_action/tree/master/cengjing/sample_app) by [Ceng jing](https://github.com/cengjing/rails_turo_in_action/tree/master/cengjing/).


This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
